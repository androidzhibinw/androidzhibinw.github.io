Any easy way to generate GIF to show something? 

One day I was thingking generate a GIF to show my project usage(recording effect video -> generate gif), I find below way work for me. 

##Recording video 

[ezvid][ezvid] is a good tool for screen recording, video edit. I find easy to record screen with it. I can select specfic area.
I can edit this vedio as a like. 

One issue is that, it is not easy to find the video just created. Defaultly it put the videos under C:\Users\yourname\Documents\ezvid\projects



##Generate GIF from video 

[ezgif][ezgif] is a excellent site for gif, [ezgif-v2g][video_to_gif] inside [ezgif][ezgif] can convert video to gif online in a minute.


##Demo it on Github 

Now [github][Github] issues can support GIF, refer [file-attachement-github][File attachments on issues] on github.

when you drag gif to [github][Github]  issues, it will show like:
